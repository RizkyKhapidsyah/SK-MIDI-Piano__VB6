SUMMARY
=======

MIDISmpl.exe is a self-extracting compressed file containing a Visual Basic
project that demonstrates controlling a MIDI device using some Windows API 
functions. You can use the code in this project to control a MIDI device 
from within your program.


MORE INFORMATION
================

When you run the self-extracting executable file, the following files are 
expanded into the MIDI Sample Project directory of your hard drive.

 - Form1.frm (16Kb)-the main form of the project.
 - MIDISmpl.vbp (1Kb)-the project file
 - MIDISmpl.vbw (1Kb)-the workspace file
 - Module1.bas (10Kb)-Module containing the API function declare statements
   and constants
 - Readme.txt-you are currently reading this document.

You can run this project using a MIDI keyboard, a mouse, or your keyboard 
as a MIDI controller. The main form has a volume control, a ten-key keyboard, 
and three menu items.

The MIDI Device menu allows to set the MIDI device to an MIDI device. The 
contents of this menu depends upon the number of MIDI output devices you have
installed in your system.

The Channel menu allows you to set what MIDI channel the project will control.

The Base Note menu allows you to set the note of the first key in the keyboard.
For example, the default setting of 60 corresponds to the middle C note. The 
first key in the keyboard or the Z key will play a middle C.

How the Sample Works
--------------------

The midiOutGetNumDevs function is used to determine if there are any MIDI 
devices and how many devices in the system. To find out the capabilities of the 
MIDI device in the system, use the midiOutGetDevCaps that contains a pointer to 
the User defined type variable containing the capability information.  The 
midiOutOpen and midiOutClose functions respectively open and close the MIDI 
devices to receive MIDI instructions. The midiOutShortMsg function is used to 
send the MIDI instruction.
